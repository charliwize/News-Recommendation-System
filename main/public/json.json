He will also outline the party&#x2019;s policies, including a requirement for firms bidding for government contracts to recognise unions and an increase in the minimum wage to &#xA3;10 an hour by 2020.</p>\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded\">\n\n</aside>\n<p>Corbyn&#x2019;s speech comes as his party scrambles to finalise a fully-costed manifesto. While a series of headline policies have been announced in recent weeks, Labour members received an email on Sunday asking them to give their views on what policies should be included. The consultation doesn&#x2019;t close until 2 May, and the Guardian understands that the Clause V committee &#x2013; the key party grouping which must sign off the plans &#x2013; is not expected to meet until 11 May.</p>\n<p>Corbyn&#x2019;s team are keen for Labour&#x2019;s campaign to be livelier than Theresa May&#x2019;s tightly-controlled strategy, and hope to benefit from what they regard as his authenticity.</p>\n<p>But the risks of that approach were underlined on Sunday when they were forced to move <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/23/jeremy-corbyn-casts-doubt-labour-support-trident-nuclear-deterrent-manifesto\" class=\"u-underline\">hastily to shut down speculation that Labour could withdraw support for Britain&#x2019;s nuclear deterrent</a>, after Corbyn appeared to leave open the idea that renewing Trident could be left out of the party&#x2019;s manifesto.</p>\n<p>In an interview on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/apr/23/jeremy-corbyn-i-want-to-achieve-a-nuclear-free-world-video\" class=\"u-underline\">BBC1&#x2019;s The Andrew Marr Show</a>, Corbyn, who has been a longstanding campaigner against nuclear proliferation, said he did not believe maintaining Trident would make the UK safer.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The issue has to be that we want a secure and peaceful world,&#x201D; Corbyn said. &#x201C;You achieve that by promoting peace and also promoting security. Security comes from that process.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>He said a Labour government would hold an immediate defence review, adding: &#x201C;We haven&#x2019;t completed work on the manifesto ... We are less than 100 hours into this election campaign. We are having this discussion within the Labour party.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards, as speculation mounted that Labour could be set to dump its backing for the nuclear deterrent &#x2013; an issue Labour MPs are deeply divided about &#x2013; a spokesperson issued a statement saying: &#x201C;The decision to renew Trident has been taken and Labour supports that.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>&#x201C;We also want Britain to do much more to pursue a proactive, multilateral disarmament strategy,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>It was the second time since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\" class=\"u-underline\">Theresa May</a> announced the snap election that Labour has had to clarify its position on key campaign issues.<br></p>\n<p>At the party&#x2019;s campaign launch event on Thursday, both Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, appeared to refuse to rule out backing a referendum on the final Brexit deal. But Labour later issued a statement saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/20/jeremy-corbyn-john-mcdonnell-speech-establishment-people-brexit\" class=\"u-underline\">a second referendum would not be in the manifesto</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>Corbyn was also pressed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewmarr\" class=\"u-underline\">Andrew Marr</a> on his approach to the use of nuclear weapons. New prime ministers are asked to write &#x201C;letters of last resort&#x201D; on their first day in office, which are sealed and given to captains of the UK&#x2019;s nuclear submarines in the event that the government is wiped out by a nuclear strike.<br></p>\n<p>Asked whether, as prime minister, he would instruct a retaliation in his letter, Corbyn said: &#x201C;I have made clear there would be no first use of it. I&#x2019;ve made clear any use of nuclear weapons would be a disaster for the whole world.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Nuclear weapons are not the solution to the world&#x2019;s security issues. They are a disaster if ever used.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>He also said he would be cautious about acting on military intelligence if he were ever asked to authorise a drone strike on the Islamic State leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi\" class=\"u-underline\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>. &#x201C;What is the objective? To have more strikes that would kill more possibly innocent people, or to get a political solution in Syria?&#x201D; Corbyn asked.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Does this help to get a political solution? I think the leader of Isis not being around would be helpful, but I would also argue that the bombing campaign has killed a large number of civilians, many of them virtual prisoners of Isis.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd\" class=\"u-underline\">Amber Rudd</a>, said the comments made it clear Corbyn would &#x201C;refuse to strike against terrorists, dismantle our nuclear defences and fail to control our borders&#x201D;.</p>\n</div></div>",

He did not have the backing of a traditional political party, had no constituency or firm voter base and was a complete unknown four years ago. </p>\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded\">\n\n</aside>\n<p>When presidential opponents questioned his standing and experience &#x2013; as they were quick to do after the Champs-Elys&#xE9;es attack on police last week &#x2013; he shot back that France&#x2019;s complacent, ineffective political class and the lacklustre political parties that have clung in power for decades had shown experience meant very little. He promised a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/16/emmanuel-macron-outsider-bid-french-presidential-race-election\" class=\"u-underline\">&#x201C;democratic revolution&#x201D;</a> against the &#x201C;vacuous&#x201D;, moribund French political system he felt voters had come to loathe.</p>\n<p>Macron&#x2019;s critics for a long time called him a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/15/french-progressives-dare-to-hope-as-maverick-macron-surges-in-polls\" class=\"u-underline\">&#x201C;champagne bubble&#x201D;</a> that would burst. A former investment banker in a country where voters distrusted banks, he had been appointed as economy minister by the Socialist Hollande. He quickly became the most popular minister. He also served as a presidential adviser in the gilded anti-chambers of the Elys&#xE9;e palace &#x2013; the architect of Hollande&#x2019;s pro-market, business-friendly reforms that so alienated voters on the left. </p>\n<p>Macron&#x2019;s presidential bid was a mass of contradictions, critics complained. He was a member of the elite top tier of the civil-service, on friendly terms with business leaders and powerbrokers, yet vowed to fight the &#x201C;system&#x201D;. </p>\n<p>He believed in always smiling and being optimistic, offering what he called &#x201C;hope and courage in the face of resignation&#x201D;, yet he was seeking election in one of the most pessimistic countries in the world, where people were exhausted by decades of mass unemployment and repeated terror attacks. He championed free market globalisation, international trade deals and the European Union at a time when fear for the future meant protectionism and Euroscepticism were gaining ground.</p>\n<p>Macron&#x2019;s central message was that he was a modern, digitally-minded, international progressive who could make the centre fashionable again, bucking the global trend for a return to nationalism and extremes.</p>\n<p>It was hard walking a centrist tightrope, pleasing both left and right. He promised better democratic accountability yet said he would spend his first summer pushing through labour reforms by presidential decree. </p>\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded\">\n\n</aside>\n<p>There was not a catchy, headline manifesto pledge that immediately stood out in voters&#x2019; minds but there was a set of what he called pragmatic plans: streamlining the pension system, expanding unemployment benefits but better controlling them, freeing a majority of households from housing tax and cutting charges and red tape for businesses. He said he wanted a more inclusive society and described France&#x2019;s colonial past in Algeria as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/16/france-inquiry-into-presidential-candidate-francois-fillon-to-remain-open\" class=\"u-underline\">&#x201C;crime against humanity&#x201D;</a>, before tempering the statement.</p>\n<p>Sitting in his shirt sleeves, eating ready meal lunches in the airless meeting rooms where he organised the first phase of his campaign, Macron would confide to visitors that the French political system was long broken and that he intended to build something new in its place &#x2013; with more women and more people from civil society in parliament seats. The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/03/emmanuel-macron-french-presidential-candidate-grassroots-movement\" class=\"u-underline\"> political movement</a>, En Marche!, was free to join online and swiftly exceeded membership of the ruling Socialist party. It promoted meetings in bistros and caf&#xE9;s where members could thrash out manifesto ideas, having their say in his project. </p>\n<p>But what stood out was how much Macron&#x2019;s presidential campaign was centred around his own persona. He gave the movement his own initials. There was no campaign director and few recognisable spokespeople &#x2013; instead the spotlight and decision-making fell firmly on him. </p>\n<p>On stage at rock star-style stadium gigs, he smiled and raise his outstretched arms to the sky. He called politics &#x201C;mystic&#x201D;. He <a href=\"http://le1hebdo.fr/numero/64/j-ai-rencontr-paul-ricoeur-qui-m-a-rduqu-sur-le-plan-philosophique-1067.html\" class=\"u-underline\">believes</a> that ever since king Louis XVI&#x2019;s head was chopped off in the revolution, France has been constantly trying to compensate for the lack of a true leader figure who could personify France. The postwar president General de Gaulle fitted the bill, he had argued but, since then, the increasingly &#x201C;ordinary&#x201D; characters who served as French president had left a kind of &#x201C;empty seat at the heart of political life&#x201D;. Macron boldly presented himself as the young face who could embody the nation.</p>\n<p>The question is whether Macron has understood the pessimism in France and its causes and whether he can address them. He argues that he has. </p>\n<p>During the campaign, one leftwing voter, an IT worker in Angers, said he worried about Macron&#x2019;s championing of the globalisation that had made so many working class people angry and sceptical of the ruling class. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t vote for Macron because he hasn&#x2019;t understood why people vote Marine Le Pen,&#x201D; the voter said. &#x201C;Which means he&#x2019;ll repeat all the same policy mistakes and in five years&#x2019; time we&#x2019;ll have Le Pen in power.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Some say Macron&#x2019;s rise has been down to luck and circumstance. Hollande&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/01/francois-hollande-not-seek-second-term-president-france\" class=\"u-underline\">decision not to run again for office</a> and the defeat of the moderate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/alain-juppe-france-prophet-happiness-presidential-wows-rally-crowd\" class=\"u-underline\">Alain Jupp&#xE9;</a> in the right&#x2019;s primary race last autumn opened up the centre ground. When the rightwing favourite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/27/penelope-gate-casts-dark-shadow-over-fillons-presidential-prospects\" class=\"u-underline\">Fran&#xE7;ois Fillon</a> was hit by scandal, it allowed Macron to overtake him in the polls. When the left-winger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/29/french-socialists-leftwing-rebel-benoit-hamon-elysee-manuel-valls-francois-hollande-presidency\" class=\"u-underline\">Beno&#xEE;t Hamon</a> won the Socialist ticket, Macron could take a chunk of the centre left. </p>\n<p>Macron&#x2019;s team argue that he made his own luck. Far from a technocrat who suddenly saw a chance for power, Macron has been thinking about and strategising a political role for himself for a long time. </p>\n</div></div>",

More people are reading the Guardian than ever, but far fewer are paying for it. Advertising revenues across the media are falling fast. <strong>And unlike many news organisations, we haven&#x2019;t put up a paywall &#x2013; we want to keep our journalism as open as we can.</strong></p>\n<p>So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian&#x2019;s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters &#x2013; because it might well be your perspective, too.</p>\n<p>If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to support it, our future would be much more secure.
